at a point with latitude 47.75, longitude 7.35 using the elevation at 0.7°. Plot the time series 
using the keyword PLOT_AND_WRITE_POINT

=======================================================================================
Modify config/processing/mf_pam_mtcy.txt to perform these exercises

dimensions 40x40 km, altitude between 1000 and 5000 m resolution and horizontal resolution of
1000 m and vertical resolution of 250 m. Hint: you have to allow the use of the grid object in
the next processing level by setting MAKE_GLOBAL and SUBSTITUTE_OBJECT

b) Add a dataset of type RAW_GRID that ingests the reflectivity. Generate a surface image at
level 0 (1000 m altitude). Hint: Use SURFACE_IMAGE of generate_grid_products

c) Add the latitude and longitude slices at a point with latitude 47.7 and longitude 6.8. Hint:
use LATITUDE_SLICE and LONGITUDE_SLICE of generate_grid_products

d) Add a cross-section between point (6.8, 47.6) and (7.2, 47.7). Hint: use CROSS_SECTION

image at level 0 (1000 m altitude) of the reflectivity an overplot the contours of RhoHV at 0.7.
Hint: Use SURFACE_CONTOUR_OVERPLOT

of the reflectivity at a point of your choice. Hint: use PLOT_AND_WRITE_POINT to plot the time
series


3. Quasi-vertical profiles (reference config/proc_examples/mf_odim_coll_qvp.txt)
================================================================================
Modify config/processing/mf_odim_coll.txt to perform these exercises

a) Using QVP create a dataset to obtain the quasi vertical profile of reflectivity, ZDR, RhoHV
and KDP using the elevation at 6°. ATTENTION: Since the 6° angle only appears every 15 min you
have to cut the radar volume to keep only this elevation. Use TIME_RANGE of generate_vol_products
to plot the data

b) Repeat the exercise but now using range_defined Quasi-vertical profiles (rQVP). You can use
full radar volume for this one.

c) Repeat the exercise but now use an enhanced vertical profile (EVP non radar centric) at the 
lat/lon position of your choice. Add another dataset and this time generate a TIME_HEIGHT at the
same position. 


4. Clutter filtering (reference config/proc_examples/mf_pam_mtcy_filter.txt)
================================================================================
Modify config/processing/mf_pam_mtcy_filter.txt to perform these exercises

a) Generate an echo identification (echoID) field using the SAN keyword. Add the field to the radar
objet. Hint: you will need the reflectivity, ZDR, RhoHV and PhiDP. 

b) Using ECHO_FILTER, filter the polarimetric variables using the echoID field that you have
generated. You will obtain variables dBZc, ZDRc, RhoHVc and PhiDPc. Plot each variable using a
different dataset.


5. Differential Phase processing and attenuation correction (reference config/proc_examples/mf_pam_mtcy_kdp.txt)
===================================================================================
Modify config/processing/mf_pam_mtcy_filter.txt to perform these exercises

a) Using the PhiDPc and dBZc obtained in the previous exercise, get the smoothed PhiDP using
the PHIDP_SMOOTH_1W method. Obtain the KDP from the smoothed PhiDP using the KDP_LEASTSQUARE_1W.
You can experiment what happens when we modifiy some of the parameters such as the window length.

b) Get a field of altitude with respect to the iso-0°C (H_ISO0) using ISO0_GRIB. Make it global because
you will need it for the next exercise. Hint: The method needs to ingest an arbitrary radar field

c) Correct for attenuation the reflectivity and the differential using the ZPhi method of ATTENUATION.
Hint: The method requires dBZc, ZDRc, PhiDPc and H_ISO0 as inputs. You will get Ah, Adp, PIA and PIDA
in addition to the reflectivity and ZDR as outputs.

Bonus exercises: Experiment with other PhiDP and KDP processing methods such as PhiDP_KDP_Maesaka.
Check the attenuation using Philin


5. Hydrometeor classification (reference config/proc_examples/mf_odim_coll_hydro.txt)

hydroMF_to_hydro

relation R=alpha*Z^beta

some fields before applying the methods


7. Melting layer detection/VPR correction (reference config/proc_examples/mf_odim_coll_ml.txt)
==============================================================================================
Modify config/processing/mf_odim_coll.txt to perform these exercises

a) generate a dataset of detection of the melting layer (ML_DETECTION) using the GIANGRANDE method.
Save the time series of the melting layer using ML_TS. The function generates the field ml
which flags the position of the range gate with respect to the melting layer. Hint: The GIANGRANDE
method needs reflectivity, ZDR, RhoHV and H_ISO0 as inputs

b) Repeat the exercise using the MF method. Do not forget to SAVE_RETRIEVED_ML to use the past
retrievals. Hint: The retrieval uses RhoHV and H_ISO0. You will have first to filter the gates
with clutter using the echoID obtained from hydroMF_to_SAN.
NOTE: The retrieval is quite slow so be patient!

c) Use the VPR method to retrieve the VPR and correct the reflectivity.
NOTE: The retrieval is quite slow so be patient!
